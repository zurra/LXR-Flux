---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Two SceneCaptures** (Top & Bottom view)
2. Custom **RDG Compute Shader** samples the HDR data
3. GPU accumulates:
   - Max Luminance
   - Encoded RGB
   - Count of bright pixels (thresholded)
4. Results are **read back once the GPU fence is complete**
5. Output is smoothed using `TCircularHistoryBuffer`
6. Final results are available to Blueprint/C++ for gameplay logic

## 🧠 Technical Breakdown

LXRFlux is a lightweight, high-performance lighting analysis system built entirely on Unreal Engine’s **Render Thread** and **Compute Shaders**. It captures average color, maximum luminance, and pixel count from your scene using the RDG (Render Dependency Graph) system, with zero game thread overhead.

### 🔁 Frame Loop Integration

- Uses Unreal’s `OnResolvedSceneColor` callback to hook directly into the **RDG render graph**, right after scene color is resolved.
- Runs entirely on the **Render Thread**, ensuring no interference with the Game Thread.
- LXRFlux supports asynchronous dispatch using **`FTSTicker`** to safely handle readback polling.

### 🎯 Scene Capture & Target

- Two `SceneCaptureComponent2D` instances positioned around a proxy mesh.
- Each capture renders to a **32×32 PF_FloatRGB RenderTarget** (GPU shared).
- These render targets provide full HDR scene information via **FinalColorHDR**.
- One capture per frame, alternating each tick, ensures steady framerate and minimal overhead.

### ⚙️ Compute Shader

- A custom HLSL shader processes the two scene captures (top & bottom) in parallel.
- The shader:
  - Loads both textures
  - Averages the RGB values
  - Computes **luminance** using standard coefficients:  
    `dot(float3(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722))`
  - Encodes values to `uint` with a defined `LUMINANCE_SCALE` (e.g., 10,000)
  - Uses **`InterlockedAdd`** to accumulate R, G, B, and filtered pixel count
  - Uses **`InterlockedMax`** to track the **maximum luminance**

### 📦 RDG Buffer Readback

- Outputs are stored in a **1x5 structured buffer**:
  ```
  [0] Encoded R
  [1] Encoded G
  [2] Encoded B
  [3] Filtered Pixel Count
  [4] Encoded Max Luminance
  ```
- Readback is handled via **`FRHIGPUBufferReadback`** and staging buffer logic
- Uses **`GraphBuilder.AddEnqueueCopyPass`** to schedule GPU readback
- Polling is done on Render Thread until the buffer is marked ready, after which the data is decoded

### 🧪 Output Interpretation

- Values are divided by `LUMINANCE_SCALE` to convert back to float
- Color and luminance data are then smoothed using `TCircularHistoryBuffer`
- Blueprint-accessible properties:
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category="LXRFlux|Detection")
  float Luminance;

  UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category="LXRFlux|Detection")
  FLinearColor Color;
  ```

### 🧩 Modularity

- Everything is encapsulated in a `ULXRFluxComponent`
- Can be dropped into any actor from the Blueprint Editor

### ⚡ Performance Note

**LXRFlux** is *blazing fast*, with nearly all logic running on the **GPU** and **Render Thread**, and minimal overhead on the **Game Thread**.  
The system is designed for maximum efficiency and minimal latency.

However, the only real bottleneck is Unreal Engine's own **Lumen Global Illumination update speed** for **Scene Captures**.  
Unreal does not update Lumen bounce lighting for SceneCaptures every frame, which may occasionally delay lighting accuracy in ultra-dynamic environments.

> 💡 This is an Unreal limitation, *not* a performance issue with LXRFlux.

If you want real-time lighting responsiveness in gameplay, consider experimenting with *Direct Lighting Only Mode* or using [**LXR**](https://docs.clusterfact.games/docs/LXR).

--- 


### 🧪 Tips to Maximize Performance

While **LXRFlux** is already extremely fast, you can further optimize performance with the following best practices:

#### ✅ Reduce Scene Capture Resolution
- Lower the `RenderTextureSize` if you're analyzing simple or localized lighting.
- Even at **32x32**, LXRFlux gives useful luminance and color results due to smart accumulation.

#### ✅ Avoid Redundant SceneCaptures
- Use the **"One Frame Per Capture"** strategy (already implemented in the system).
- Avoid enabling `bCaptureEveryFrame` unless you're debugging.

#### ✅ Use Only Required Channels
- Avoid capturing unnecessary render features:
  - Turn off `ShowFlags.Materials`, `ShowFlags.AntiAliasing`, `ShowFlags.ToneMapper`, etc.
  - Disable PostProcessing if you only care about raw lighting.

#### ✅ Enable Direct Light-Only Mode (Optional)
- If you don't need indirect bounce info, limit detection to **direct lighting** for instant response.

#### ✅ Capture Only What Matters
- Use `ShowOnlyComponents` or `HideComponent()` to restrict SceneCapture to the key actors/lights.
- Example: Only capture your lighting proxy mesh or zone.

#### ✅ Keep SceneCapture Mesh Simple
- Use a low-poly lighting proxy mesh (e.g., a cube dome) to catch bounces efficiently.

### 🔁 From LXR to LXRFlux

**LXRFlux** is a spin-off project from the LXR system, designed to be **open-source, accessible**, and perfect for devs wanting **GPU-level light awareness** in their game.

**LXRFlux** is a **lightweight, standalone indirect lighting detection system**—built as a distilled version of the much larger **[LXR]([https://clusterfact.games](https://docs.clusterfact.games/docs/LXR))** system.

After building **LXR**, which includes advanced detection subsystems like:

- 🔦 **Silhouette Detection**  
- 🧠 **Light Memory and Anomaly Tracing**  
- 👁️ **Beam Awareness and Light Volume Sense**  
- 🎮 **Gameplay Ability System (GAS) Integration**

…it became clear that **indirect lighting detection** deserved its own dedicated, GPU-accelerated solution.

**LXRFlux** was born from that realization.

Here's a clean and focused TODO list based on that content:

### 🛠️ LXRFlux – Advanced TODO

1. **Investigate Custom Pixel Shader Path (Optional)**
   - Explore replacing `SceneCaptureComponent2D` with a custom render pass or manual scene view capture.
   - Gain finer control over rendering and materials.
   - *Note:* This is highly advanced and likely overkill unless developing an engine fork.

2. **Explore GPU-Only Detection (Experimental)**
   - Consider a full GPU pipeline: compute shader → UAV → light tagging in screen space.
   - This would avoid any CPU readback entirely.
   - *Tradeoff:* Would lose game-thread-friendly access to luminance values.

3. **Consider Async Compute Queue (Not currently needed)**
   - Only relevant if compute shader becomes heavier or starts conflicting with graphics work.
   - Current use is lightweight; no need to split into a dedicated async compute queue yet.

4. **Improve Code Documentation**
   - Add inline comments to key areas of RDG/compute dispatch.
   - Document shader input/output formats and logic.
   - Clarify RenderThread vs GameThread roles throughout.
